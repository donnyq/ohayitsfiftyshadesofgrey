“He leans down and kisses me, his fingers still moving rhythmically
 inside me, his thumb circling and pressing. His other hand scoops
 my hair off my head and holds my head in place. His tongue mirrors
 the actions of his fingers, claiming me. My legs begin to stiffen
 as I push against his hand. He gentles his hand, so I’m brought
 back from the brink ... I come instantly again and again, falling
 apart beneath him … then I’m building again … I climax anew,
 calling out his name.” (195, 196)
