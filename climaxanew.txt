“He leans down and kisses me, his ruddy red claws still moving rhythmically
 inside me, his pincers circling and pinching. His other claw scoops
 my hair off my head and holds my head in place. His mandibles mirrors
 the actions of his claws, claiming me. My legs begin to stiffen
 as I push against his claw. He gentles his claw, so I’m brought
 back from the brink ... I come instantly again and again, falling
 apart beneath him … then I’m building again … I climax anew,
 calling out his name -- 'ZOIDBERG!!!'” (195, 196)
